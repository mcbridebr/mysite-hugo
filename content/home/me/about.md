Hi, i'm Brandon. I am a DevOps Engineer, husband, and a father of three.  My technical interests lie mostly with **linux**, **automation**, **infrastructure**, and **DevOps**. 

When not at work I enjoy **jiu jitsu**, **gaming**, **woodworking**, and **photography**.  Aside from spending time with my family of course.

Something like that, i'm not the best at these.
